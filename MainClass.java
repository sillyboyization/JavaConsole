/*
 * Simply put, the point of this project is to explain Java to brand new coders in English on Microsoft Windows.
 * 
 * You will need a few things before being able to write code in Java:
 * 1: The 32 bit version of Java. Java can be downloaded at http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp After you
 * download Java, install it. If you don't know how to install Java, you should probably quit now.
 * 2: The 32 bit version of the Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers. Eclipse downloaded at
 * http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ After you have downloaded Eclipse, extract it to wherever you want then run Eclipse
 * from inside the Eclipse folder.
 * After you get Eclipse all set up, click File -> New -> Project
 * Make a new Java project named ConsoleProject. After that you will find an icon right below file, click it and create
 * a new class with the name MainClass. Look in the top right corner and make sure that Java EE is selected and not Java.
 * Then in the left corner expand ConsoleProject (If it isn't already), then src, then (default package), and double
 * click MainClass.java If there is currently no code inside MainClass.java, copy and paste the code below into the text
 * field:

public class MainClass
{
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		System.out.print("Hello World!");
	}
}

 * READ: I'm pretty tired, so I'm going to go to bed. If anybody cares to commit in more information, please do it. Do
 * not import things, or it might confuse the user. I plan on importing things inside of external class files later,
 * such as the Scanner. Always make sure there is a new line at the end of the file for GitHub.
